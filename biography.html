            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>Tatiana Riquelme was born in Miami, Florida and graduated from Design and Architecture Senior High school (DASH).
                    While in DASH she was given the privilege of exhibiting her work in Art Basal as part of the student exhibition as well as in the Design District.
                    As a result of her accomplishments, she was granted a partial scholarship from the Rosa and Carlos de la Cruz and the Knight Foundation.
                    She then went on to study Fine Arts in Florida International University Honors College where she won a multitude of awards in competitions
                    held by the Honors College including 1st and 2nd prize in painting for two consecutive years and also in Miami-Dade College
                    where she received an associates in Fine Arts.
                </p>
                <p> In 2013, Tatiana earned the honor of exhibiting her work at Cuba Nostalgia Expo where she was able to meet
                    with the esteemed Cuban dissident Guillermo Farinas, who played an integral part in inspiring her
                    artwork during this time. Tatiana’s career has been characterized by a fusion of her Cuban heritage with her personal interests,
                    actualizing paintings that juxtapose woman and identity. Her latest series revolves around emphasizing the strength,
                    and beauty of ballet dancers as well as the veiled sacrifices that shroud the artistry of these dancers in an attempt
                    to elucidate the grace and intensity of femininity. This series won the contest to represent the lX
                    International Ballet Festival and was exhibited in the Miami Hispanic Ballet White house. 
                </p>
                <p>Tatiana was inspired by her admiration for the many Cuban ballet dancers who have defected in order to pursue their
                dreams as artists and to travel the world showcasing their astounding talents.
                Her work is filled with these type of stories, collected memories of herself and of her Cuban heritage,
                which she then reflects on introspectively to ascertain and approach a sense of identity and meaning.
                These memories are filled with bold colors that exude vividity, allowing the viewer to feel present in this fleeting moment in time.
                    This evanescence of time is shown with elaborations of movement through brash gallant brush strokes.
                </p>
                <p>Her ballerina exhibit for The 19th Annual International Ballet Festival of Miami was displayed at 
                    The Miami Hispanic Cultural Arts Center in the summer of 2013</p>
